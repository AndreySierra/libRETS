Installing the Prequisites
==========================

gcc

Earlier versions of gcc do not have good C++ support.

Boost
-----

  Version: 1.44.0 or higher.
  URL: http://www.boost.org/

Boost has it's own build system, bjam.  Read it's instructions for
installation.  You need to compile and install the filesystem and
program options libraries.

libcurl
-------

  Version: 7.18.2 or higher.
  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

Build as per its instructions.  No special steps are needed.

Expat
-----

  Version: 1.95.8 or higher.

Java SDK
--------

  Version: 1.4.2 or higher.

ANTLR
-----

Building librets
================

Run the following commands:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  % ./configure 
  % make
  % sudo make install

If boost or expat can't be found, then you may need to override that with
switches to the configure step. For example, if boost and expat were beneath 
/opt/local/, then you'd:

  % ./configure --with-boost-prefix=/opt/local --with-expat-prefix=/opt/local
